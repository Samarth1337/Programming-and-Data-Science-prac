# Programming-and-Data-Science-prac
For self-accountability reasons, I've started uploading some of my practiced questions here. P.S I don't upload all my coded problems here, nor do I follow any structure for my learning and practiced problems. The goal is to learn anything and everything I feel curious about, no matter how easy or hard!

I don't limit myself to any language, framework, or core concept. I dabble in everything I can, including both DSA as well as core Data Science/ML problems.
